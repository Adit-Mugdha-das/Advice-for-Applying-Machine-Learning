# Advice for Applying Machine Learning 

This assignment explores practical strategies for improving model performance, especially in the presence of **skewed datasets**.  
It is part of **Week 3 (Course 2: Advanced Learning Algorithms)** in the **Machine Learning Specialization** by **Andrew Ng** on Coursera.

##  Description

In this lab, I evaluated models using precision, recall, and F1-score to better handle **imbalanced classes**. I also compared algorithms using error metrics and performed error analysis to make informed decisions on feature engineering and algorithm choice.

### Key Topics Covered:
- Handling skewed/imbalanced datasets
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Error analysis and data inspection
- Impact of data imbalance on model performance
- Practical strategies for improving ML models

## Files Included

- `ml_advice_lab.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with guided exercises and implementations
- `lab_utils_adv.py`: Utility functions for metric computation and plotting
- `data/`: Datasets used to evaluate and compare classifiers

> ⚠️ This repository includes only my own implementation and strictly follows Coursera’s Honor Code.

##  Tools Used

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
